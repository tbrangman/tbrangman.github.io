		<p>International Programs is an organization at Purdue University that specializes in intercultural programming, training, learning, mentorship, research, and grant writing. The goal of the organization is to better develop intercultural competence in Purdue students, faculty, and staff through various workshops, events, and field trips.</p>

		<h2>Marketing? Wow, I've never done that before...</h2>
		<p>Prior to this role, my experience with marketing was nonexistent. I believed marketing was just promotional material (flyers, coupons, etc.) that compelled a consumer to want to buy something; I was wrong. </p>

		<h2>Combating low attendance</h2>
		<p>Before joining the International Programs Marketing team (two-man team), attendance at department-sponsored events was low. Other than international students on the email list, the organization was still widely unknown to a majority of domestic students. My job was to increase campus awareness and attendance at these events.</p>

		<h2>Visualizing success</h2>
		<p>After months of testing email templates, interviewing students, I was able to identify a gap in viewer-ship and attendance of students after viewing event emails. Most emails were either going straight to spam, deleted immediately, and or no one even "knew" about the upcoming events (most college students tend to miss emails). We looked into different email marketing software/applications and eventually settled on MailChimp. In addition to a complete overhaul on the look and feel of the weekly newsletters, daily scheduling of events on our Facebook Page coupled with utilizing Facebook's extensive advertising tools, I was able to increase views by 50%, event attendance by 30% and grow the page from 700 followers to 1400 by the end of the internship.</p>
