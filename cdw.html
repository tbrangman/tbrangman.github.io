		<p>CDW Corporation is a Fortune 500 company that provides technology products and services for businesses, governments, and educational institutions.</p>

		<h2>First contact</h2>
		<p>I was able to work with CDW Corporation in the summer of 2016 as they were gearing toward a revamped mobile website after years of using the same interface. The company would be completing their first rounds of rebranding on web and mobile, moving toward a more modern design.</p>

		<h2>My role</h2>
		<p>During my internship, my colleague (another college student) and I was tasked with the implementation of phase one for their new mobile website rebranding. Phase one included: smoother product search, autocomplete search, and updated UI development. I worked closely with the UX team to understand their vision for the new rebranding and assist in turning their vision into a functional experience online. I was able to take part in design sprints and provide my knowledge as a web developer to determine the feasibility and usefulness of certain features.</p>

		<h2>Technical solutions</h2>
		<p>The finished product included new UI elements, updated marketing content for the landing page, connection of the back-end warehouse storage system with the front-end UI, newly-designed menu, optimization, unit testing, and a product icon style guide for the Marketing team.</p>
