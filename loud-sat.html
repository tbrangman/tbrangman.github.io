		<p>Loud Saturdaze is a media company and music incubator that utilizes music, technology, and data to tell stories. The company was started through the creation of music videos on YouTube and will eventually start creating hip hop documentaries and partnering with artists. This is an ongoing project funded and executed by myself creating everything from the branding, design, to development.</p>
