		<p>Loud Saturdaze is a new type of digital media company that creates technology, digital content, and music. What has started as a music incubator will blossom into a multi-faceted company that will create content for the new web generation. This is an ongoing project funded by a group of friends with my expertise focusing on their branding and web structure.</p>

		<h2>Landing page</h2>
		<p>While the company is defining their place in the digital atmosphere, a landing page will be released later this year before the official release of the brand in early 2020. The current page is in a developmental phase.</p>
