		<p>GERI Education is a Purdue University institute initiative that focuses on the study, research, and development of the human potential. The website specifically for their Total School Cluster Grouping was in need of a modern day redesign as the previous site was 15 years dated.</p>

		<h2>My very first "client"</h2>
		<p>Although, this was an internship, it was run more as a freelance role where a certain criteria was given and I was expected to have a final deliverable by a certain delivery date.</p>

		<h2>Initial sketches</h2>
		<p>Pictured below are a few sketches of the the website layout, criteria, and personas.</p>

		<h2>Things I'd do differently</h2>
		<p>If I could, I would do a few things differently. While the client's needs were met, I personally felt my design decisions were not the greatest. I would change a few elements to create a more cohesive interface that was more visually pleasing. White text on a white background photo (yuck), unnecessary text-shadow on menus and text (yikes). Additionally, I would do more browser testing as there are a few CSS bugs that affect the overall design.</p>
