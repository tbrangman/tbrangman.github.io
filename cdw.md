description: During the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to work with another intern on code development for the new rebranding for CDWâ€™s mobile site. Their mobile site before the redesign was lacking in design, usability, and ultimately led to lower conversions than their desktop site. Further research proved that mobile is a growing market and in order to capitalize on that, a new design was in need.
