		<span>Problem:</span><p>T.R. Oneal, the CGT job board coordinator receives many job ads directed at CGT students, but not all of them get the students’ attention. Students might be looking for jobs or internships but somehow miss or misplace the emails that he sends.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="case-paragraph">
		<span>User Research:</span><p>To begin, our group formulated a user research plan to understand student methods of applying to jobs, what mediums they apply through, etc. We interviewed 15 CGT students of various grade levels and genders to obtain a variety of information to be analyzed and narrowed down as we moved down the user experience pipeline. Next, we used affinity diagramming to categorize responses to develop a persona/scenario.

		<span>Persona/Scenario:</span><p>John E. Smith, a Purdue University, CGT sophomore is doing his CGT 256 homework. Suddenly, he receives an email update that new jobs have been posted on the CGT job board website. He opens up his browser and navigates to the CGT job board, a website that caters to showing CGT students new jobs and or internships at Purdue or in the Lafayette area. John conducts a quick search, “Web Design Intern”. He spends a little time searching and browsing, shuffling through the many opportunities. <br /><br />John quickly finds a company and description that sounds interesting, reading details on the requirements and skills needed in order to be success at the internship. John quickly presses the apply button, an email opens up and he submits his resume and cover letter. John has successfully completed his goal - he has found an internship he wanted and was able to apply quickly and efficiently.</p>

	<div class="case-paragraph">
		<span>Wireframing:</span><p>Before starting our wireframing session, our group gathered to discuss levels of interactions including a list of different requirements emphasized during our interviews. We used a scaling system to filter the different requirements as a means for each of us to be satisfied. After the requirements we then sketched different models we felt would fulfill those requirements.</p>

		<h3>Levels of Interaction:</h3>
		<span class="secondary-span">Activities: Identifying, Applying<br />
			Tasks: Locating, Browsing, Favoriting, Categorizing<br />
			Interactions: Filtering, Comparing, Navigating<br />
			Events: Clicking, Typing, Tapping, Scrolling, Pinching

		<span>Usability Testing:</span><p>To validate our cognitive walkthough, we tested our application with real users on three factors: time, efficiency, and simplicity. Using quantitative metrics we categorized: successful completion of a task (Likert Scale), error rates, and time spent completing a task. Afterwards, we asked if there was any general feedback on the flow of our application. Recommendations included the relocation of certain elements (apply, button, edit icon) and the changing of icons to words as it is more easily understood.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="case-paragraph">
		<span>Results/Takaways:</span><p>While, we could have retouched the prototype and ran more usability tests, time was a major constraint during the project. Generally more tests would be ran after another round of wireframe iteration. In the end, I learned quite a bit. There is a lot of value in doing early research about your problem and users. Personas and scenarios can really help grasp who and what types of people you are designing for. Additionally, usability testing is not a one-and-done activity. Many designs will go through several iterations before a final wireframe can be completed.</p>
